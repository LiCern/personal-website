            <ol>
                <li>I’m a postgraduate researcher in philosophy by day, keen developer-in-training by night and dilettante art-tinkering painter and poet on weekends!</li>

                <br>

                <li>I have a burning passion for social issues, especially those at the crossroads of

                    <br>

                <li>I am a crazy-plant-lady: over the past three years I have turned little London flats where I've lived into urban jungles. 
                    I use gardening as a practice of mindfulness and loving kindness and, not only is it a great tool for mental health, but my plants seem to love it too 
                    (aside from the relentless sing-along to David Bowie’s Platinum Collection, maybe).
                </li>
                
                <br>

                <li>At 17, I moved to the UK by myself, my English was poor and I was broke. 
                    Eight years later I have made a family out of friends and a home out of this country: 
                    it is my proudest accomplishment.

                    I suggest you join it for daily entertaining and lots of hilariously angry Italians.

            <h3>“Girls don’t code!”, fantabulous women in tech & why I want to be part of FAC</h3>

            <h4>Has anyone ever told you that you could not do something because of your biological gender?</h4>

            <br>
      
            <div class="fac-text">
                <p>Growing up in a little Italian village, I always preferred playing with the boys because they got to do all the fun things: 
                climbing trees, hunting beetles and lizards, play fighting and bike racing. Since those days of fun and games I have felt the 
                expectations and demands of my biological gender and my defiant spirit towards them has not changed a bit.</p>
            
                <p>Fast forward a decade, I went to university to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics, thinking “this is the right degree 
                to get somewhere where I can do something that matters”. I got involved in the societies where I felt like I could start doing 
                that something: LGBTQ+, Labour and International society in particular. I read so much feminist literature, I studied how political 
                change happens and yet, I had not found what I like to call my “niche”. You know what I mean: the angle, the point from which you can 
                actually make a difference to someone.</p>
                
                <p>Then, someone I was friends with a the time, who was studying towards an undergraduate in Computer Science, during a discussion 
                about how many languages we knew told me he know 12 languages. I was astonished: I speak three and learning them was no joke. 
                He “mansplained” how computer languages are kind of similar and once you learn one, learning others is only a matter of syntax, 
                so I told him that, maybe, I was going to try out coding. He laughed: “Girls don’t code! There’s not a single girl in my department, you're just not cut out for it”.</p>
                <p>That was the start of my coding journey.</p>
                
                <p>Starting anything is generally always terrifying and coding is no different. So, I sought out safe spaces: I joined 
                    <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/" style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>WWCode UK</a> (through which I got a scholarship for Codesmith’s Javascript for Beginners), 
                    started an Introduction to Web Development course with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/" style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>CodeFirstGirls</a>
                    and begun attending <a href="https://codebar.io/" style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>Codebar</a> meet-ups. The support, encouragement 
                    and solidarity I received from people in these organisations is astonishing. I listened avidly to their stories and unconventional journeys to software 
                    engineering and the message was always the same: “you can do it”.</p>
                
                <p>I started thinking about the stereotypes around coding, how it is made to look quite exclusive and inaccessible, especially 
                    for people who find themselves at the intersection of certain identity markers; for example, those of gender, ethnicity and 
                    faith, as could be the example of a muslim woman of colour. This thought disturbed me deeply.</p>
                
                <p><em>How can technology cater to all those different identities if it is mostly designed 
                    by the same category of people (i.e. white men), which can easily introduce their biases into the technology? The solution is clear: 
                    the only way we can ensure that new technology we build is unbiased is to <b>enable a wider group of people to access and be 
                    part of that building stage.</b></em> </p>
                    
                <p>However, “[e]ven when women are choosing computer science, they can end up in school and work environments that are 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html" style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>inhospitable</a>".
                    We are also less likely to enter the field - and stick with it - when female role models, mentors and collaborators are lacking.</p>
                
                <p>From meeting FAC graduates (and even being mentored by some of them!) at the Codebar events, to the past few weeks of marvellous pair-programming, 
                    to collaborating with another applicant (his work <a href="https://jhart5.github.io/fac-application-site/?fbclid=IwAR2iwGGaUfHbb02bOdITv4GmR1N5MIPKZ6iMfoB3033pr-uq7PWjM9YpF18"
                    style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>here</a>!) on writing the carousel, I feel like I got to really experience that safe, cooperative and inclusive environment which fuels 
                    FAC’s missions of social impact and tech industry diversification, which is exactly where I want to be.</p>

                <p style='color: #f13f3d;'>Being part of the creation of that welcoming safe learning environment, improving accessibility to the tech industry for other women and minorities,
                    giving others the same opportunities and help I have received from the above mentioned organisations and, hopefully, a lot more: 
                    this is why I want to be part of FAC and why I want to become a developer, this is my niche.</p>
