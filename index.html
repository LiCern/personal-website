            <h2>fun facts & a little about me</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>I’m a postgraduate researcher in philosophy by day, passionate developer-in-training by night and dilettante art-tinkering painter and poet on weekends!</li>
                <br>
                <li>I have a burning passion for social issues, especially those at the crossroads of <a id="ted-talk" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality/transcript?language=en#t-1113920" 
                    style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>intersectional feminism.</a></li>
                <br>
                <li>I am a crazy-plant-lady: over the past three years I have turned little London flats where I've lived into urban jungles. 
                I use gardening as a practice of mindfulness and loving kindness and, not only is it a great tool for mental health, but my plants seem to love it too 
                (except when I relentlessly sing-along to David Bowie’s Platinum Collection).</li>
                <br>
                <li>At 17, I moved to the UK by myself, my English was poor and I was broke. Eight years later I have made a family out of friends and a home out of this country: it is my proudest accomplishment.</li>
                <br>
                <li>My favourite page on Facebook is called <a id="italians-mad" href=https://www.facebook.com/italiansmadatfood/ style='color: #f13f3d; text-decoration: underline;'>Italians Mad at Food</a>. The principle is “post an attempt an Italian cuisine and wait for Italians to rip it apart”. 
                I suggest you join it for daily entertaining and lots of hilariously angry Italians.</li>

            <h3>“Girls don’t code!”, fantabulous women in tech & why I want to be part of FAC (a.k.a my coding journey)</h3>

        <h4>Has anyone ever told you that you could not do something because of your biological gender? 
        If you belong to the queer community or, most likely, simply identify as a woman the answer is probably yes.</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="div9text">
        <p>Growing up in a little Italian village, I always preferred playing with the boys because they got to do all the fun things: 
        climbing trees, hunting beetles and lizards, play fight and race on bikes. Since those days of fun and games I have felt the 
        expectations and demands of my biological gender and my defiant spirit towards them has not changed a bit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fast forward a decade, I went to university to study philosophy, politics and economics, thinking “this is the right degree 
        to get somewhere where I can do something that matters”. I got involved in the societies where I felt like I could start doing 
        that something: Labour, LGBTQ+ and International society in particular. I read so much feminist literature, I studied how political 
        change happens and yet, I had not found what I like to call my “niche”. You know what I mean: the angle, the point in which you can actually make a difference to someone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then, someone I was friends with a the time, who was studying towards an undergraduate in Computer Science, during a discussion 
        about how many languages we knew told me he know 12 languages. I was astonished: I speak three and learning them was no joke. 
        He “mansplained” how computer languages are kind of similar and once you learn one, learning others is only a matter of syntax, 
        so I told him that, maybe, I was going to try out coding. He laughed: “girls don’t code! There’s not a single girl on my course 
        and the couple ones in the whole department are gremlins”.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That was the start of my coding journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Starting anything is generally always terrifying and coding is no different. So, I sought out safe spaces: I joined WWCode UK, 
        started an Introduction to Web Development course with CodeFirstGirls and begun attending Codebar meet-ups. The support, encouragement 
        and solidarity I have received from people in these organisations is unprecedented. I listened avidly to their stories and their (mostly) 
        unconventional journey to software engineering and the message has always been “you can do it”.</p>
