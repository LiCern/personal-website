# ❀ My application website for FAC20 ❀

I have created this one-page website as part of my application to the Founders and Coders* summer 2020 cohort.

It is <b>written entirely in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript</b>. It does not use a Github theme or any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity. 

In the collaborative spirit that is at the heart of FAC, the image carousel was <b>co-written</b> with <a href="https://github.com/jhart5" target="_blank">Josh Hart</a>.
